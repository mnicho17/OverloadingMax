# OverloadingMax
Module 6 Discussion: Overloading Max
Module 6 is entitled: "Methods".

Consider the code that is in page 220, Listing 6.9: TestMethodOverloading.java file.

Consider at lines 6, 10, and 14 the invoking of the max() method.

Consider at lines 18, 26, and 34 the actual code for the max methods:

line 18:

public static int max(int num1, int num2) {

line 26:

public static double max(double num1, double num2) {

line 34:

public static double max(double num1, double num2, double num3) {

1- Your task is to replace the invoking of the "max" methods at lines 6,10, and 14 with the "min" method.(6 points)

In order to do the task, first take out the code with the "max" method

2- Write your own "min" methods code in lines 18, 26, and 34 . Make sure that min method is producing the correct result. If your code does not produce the same result I will take points away.(24 points).

Save your code and submit the java file under your: lastname_firstname_TestMethodOverloading.java
